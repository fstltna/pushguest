# pushguest 1.0.0
Pushes a updated "guest" account to multiple hotline servers on Linux

Strongly suggest you use them for the easiest use of this script.

This way you can update only one server and automatically push that guest account to multiple other servers.

NOTE: This script will require modification if your servers are not set up the same as mine!

You need to install a Perl module like this before running this script:

# cpan -i Net::OpenSSH
